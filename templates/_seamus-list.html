	<p>We made you a mixtape. A really long mixtape. In the past, we've kept this list, of our favorite songs of the year, to 100 songs. A nice, round, semi-arbitrary number that always meant leaving out dozens of our favorites.</p>
	<p>You can scan the complete list of songs below, but to get the full experience click the launch link below to hear them all. You can sort by genre or select a playlist created by members of NPR Music's staff and our member station partners, or just hit shuffle and listen until you find a new favorite of your own.</p>
